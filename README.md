# AO3 Paragraph Spacing Fixer

A small browser extension that removes extra blank lines between paragraphs when pasting text into AO3 from Google Docs or similar editors.

## What it does
- Removes unnecessary blank lines between paragraphs
- Does not affect fonts, italics, or text content
- Runs locally in your browser and does not collect any data

## When to use it
Use this after pasting text into AO3 and before publishing, if you notice large gaps between paragraphs.

## Installation (Chrome)
1. Download this repository as a ZIP
2. Unzip the folder
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
4. Turn on **Developer mode**
5. Click **Load unpacked**
6. Select the unzipped folder
7. Make sure the selected folder directly contains manifest.json.


## Notes
- This extension targets standard editable text fields like AO3’s editor
- It does not work inside Reddit’s comment editor
